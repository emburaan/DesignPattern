# Design Patterns

A comprehensive collection of software design patterns implemented with practical examples and detailed explanations.

## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a learning resource and reference guide for understanding and implementing various design patterns in software development. Each pattern includes theoretical background, practical implementations, and real-world use cases.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Educational Resource**: Learn design patterns through clear examples and explanations
- **Reference Guide**: Quick lookup for pattern implementations and best practices
- **Code Examples**: Production-ready code samples for common design scenarios
- **Best Practices**: Demonstrate proper implementation techniques and principles

## 🏗️ Design Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access
- **Factory Method** - Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Abstract Factory** - Creates families of related objects
- **Builder** - Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype** - Creates objects by cloning existing instances

### Structural Patterns
Deal with object composition and relationships between entities.

- **Adapter** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Decorator** - Adds new functionality to objects dynamically
- **Facade** - Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Composite** - Composes objects into tree structures
- **Proxy** - Provides placeholder/surrogate for another object

### Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities.

- **Observer** - Defines one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Strategy** - Defines family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Command** - Encapsulates requests as objects
- **State** - Allows object to alter behavior when internal state changes
- **Iterator** - Provides way to access elements sequentially

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Programming language runtime (specify your language, e.g., Java 8+, Python 3.7+, C# .NET Core 3.1+)
- IDE or text editor of choice
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/emburaan/DesignPattern.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd DesignPattern

# Install dependencies (if applicable)
# npm install  # for Node.js projects
# pip install -r requirements.txt  # for Python projects
# dotnet restore  # for .NET projects
```

### Running Examples
```bash
# Navigate to specific pattern directory
cd Creational/Singleton

# Compile and run (adjust for your language)
javac *.java && java Main  # Java
python main.py             # Python
dotnet run                 # C#
```

## 📚 Pattern Implementation Guide

Each pattern directory contains:
- `README.md` - Pattern explanation, benefits, and use cases
- Implementation files with clear, commented code
- `example.txt` or `demo` files showing practical usage
- Unit tests demonstrating pattern behavior
- UML diagrams (where applicable)

## 🔍 When to Use Each Pattern

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Database connections, logging, caching
- **Factory**: Creating UI elements, database drivers
- **Builder**: Creating complex configuration objects
- **Prototype**: Creating similar objects efficiently

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Integrating third-party libraries
- **Decorator**: Adding features without inheritance
- **Facade**: Simplifying complex APIs
- **Proxy**: Lazy loading, access control

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Event handling, MVC architectures
- **Strategy**: Payment processing, sorting algorithms
- **Command**: Undo/redo functionality, queuing operations
- **State**: State machines, game character behavior

## 🛠️ Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-pattern`)
3. **Implement** the pattern with proper documentation
4. **Add** tests and examples
5. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new pattern: [PatternName]'`)
6. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-pattern`)
7. **Create** a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines
- Follow existing code style and structure
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Add practical examples and use cases
- Ensure code is well-tested
- Update this README if adding new patterns
